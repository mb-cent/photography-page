                <h3>Exposure Triangle</h3><!--Eventually go more into what stops in future editions.-->
                <ol>
                    <li>ISO</li>
                    <p>
                        ISO is a unit that was created for camera film to measure how sensitive it is to light exposure.<br>
                        Higher ISO values are more sensitive to light, but also appear more "grainy" in the final result.<br>
                        Digital photography allows you to change the ISO of the digital sensor, which is one of the advantages of digital photography.
                    </p>
                    <li>Aperature Size</li>
                    <p>
                        Aperatures allow you to change the amount of light that enters the camera,
                        which affects the depth of field of the image produced.<br>
                        Larger aperatures let more light in while reducing the depth of field of the image,
                        while smaller aperatures reduce the amount of light whlle increasing the depth of field.<br>
                        Because depth of field has the most drastic impact on the appearance of the photo taken,
                        it's arguably more important than ISO, especially for digital photgraphy.
                    <li>Shutter Speed</li>
                    <p>
                        Shutter speed is the amount of time the shutter stays open, allowing the film/sensor to take in more light.<br>
                        Faster shutter speeds are great for taking pictures of moving subjects,<br>
                        while slower shutter speeds are great for taking photos of stationary subjects, like landscapes.

                <h3>Types of Lenses</h3>
                <p></p><!--Add brief explanation of the importance of lenses over camera body here.-->
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard (35mm-50mm)</li>
                    <p>
                        35mm-50mm is around the focal range of our eyes, so photos of subjects taken with standard lenses look familiar.<br>
                        Frequent photography types with standard lens include portrait photography and street photography.
                    </p>
                    <li>Wide Angle (&lt;35mm)</li>
                    <p>
                        Lenses less than 35mm can take in light from a wider field of view, making this ideal for landscape photography.
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>Telephoto (>80mm)</li>
                    <p>
                        Telephoto lenses can focus on subjects very far away from the camera.This is mostly used for wildlife photography.
                    </p>
                </ul>
